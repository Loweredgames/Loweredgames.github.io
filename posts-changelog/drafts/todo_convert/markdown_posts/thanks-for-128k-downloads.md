Â hi guys i wanted to thank you for all the downloads. now the map is on the first page at the bottom.thanks again i hope you like the map and send me some suggestions.in the future I will continue to update the map. now I'm waiting for 1.18.2 to come out and when 1.19 gets to the first pre-release (maybe I won't) I'll start updating it. let's see what Mojang want to add.
